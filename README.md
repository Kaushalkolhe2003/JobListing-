## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete job posts.
- Custom search functionality to find job listings.
- Uses Spring Data JPA for data persistence.
- RESTful APIs for interacting with the job listings.
- Maven-based project for easy dependency management and build process.

  - `JoblistingApplication.java`: Entry point of the Spring Boot application.
  - `Repository/`: Contains repository interfaces and classes for database operations.
  - `controller/PostController.java`: Manages HTTP requests for job posts.
  - `model/Post.java`: Represents the job post data model.
